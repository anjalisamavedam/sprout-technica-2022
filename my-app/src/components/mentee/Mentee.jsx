            <h3>Make Budgeting a Habit</h3>
            <p>Think of a budget as a spending plan to guide your spending and saving so you can have the things you really want. Don't get sucked into trying to afford a certain lifestyle if it's not possible right now.</p>

            <p>Ideally, you want to have three to six months' worth of expenses saved up. But don't let that number intimidate you. Start small while you build your fund, for example, by setting aside $50 per month. An extra $500 or $1,000 will help out a lot when you have surprise expenses.</p>
